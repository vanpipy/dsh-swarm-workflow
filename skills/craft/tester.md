# The tester's craft

## 1. How to use this file

The skill owns the **process**: what a Tester does, in what order, and what
the report has to carry. This file owns the **craft of the check** — how the
oracle is chosen, how a check is made to discriminate, and what makes a
result worth reporting. Nothing here repeats the process; everything here is
about the thing the process asks for.

`shared.md`, beside this file, holds the shared core: the three checks that
hold in every language, the twelve pieces, the review smells. This file says
how a Tester applies that core. Where the two overlap, this file is the
narrower reading of it, for the Tester's hand.

Everything here is a rule you can be shown to have followed or broken. If a
piece cannot be checked, it is advice, not guidance — treat advice as optional
and guidance as binding.

Read the piece that matches the check you are about to write, before you write
it. A brief names this file and the section that applies: "read §3 of the
tester's craft before you write the assertion". A brief that names a role and
no piece leaves the lane guessing what good looks like.

The language file under `languages/` carries the idioms. The repository's own
conventions win where they disagree with any of these files.

## 2. Choose the oracle

The oracle is the observable behaviour the requirement names. It is the thing
a reader of the requirement would see if they ran the artifact themselves.

* The oracle is the observable behaviour the requirement names, never the
  implementation's own value.
* A test that asserts what the code returns is not a check of what the code
  should return. It restates the implementation, and passes for any
  implementation, including the wrong one.
* Name the source of the expected value: the requirement, the specification, a
  second method, or a hand count. Write that source in the test, so the next
  reader can check the value without asking.
* Derive the expected value from the requirement before you read the
  implementation, so the implementation cannot tell you what to expect.
* Re-derive a computed expected value a second way: a second tool, a
  different algorithm, a hand count. Two methods that agree are evidence; one
  is an assertion.
* The check is black-box: it runs through the public surface. A check that
  reaches into a private helper tests the implementation, and breaks on a
  rename that changed no behaviour.
* Where the wording of the output is the contract, pin the wording exactly and
  say in the test why the wording is the contract.
* A requirement with no observable oracle is reported as such. Do not invent
  one, and do not pass a check you could not define.

## 3. Make the check discriminate

A check discriminates when it can give two different answers for two different
behaviours. A check that gives the same answer either way proves nothing about
the behaviour.

* For each case, name the value that separates the two answers: a boundary, a
  type, a sign, a count, an error instead of a value.
* A case whose expected value differs from its sibling's is the case that
  discriminates. A case whose expected value matches the one before it adds
  no evidence.
* A check that compares the wrong thing — a substring where a call was meant,
  a name where a behaviour was meant — passes for the wrong reason and is
  worse than no check, because it buys confidence it cannot pay for.
* One behaviour per check. A check that asserts five things tells the reader
  which one failed only by running it five times.
* Assert on the observable result, not on the intermediate that produced it.
* Name the behaviour in the check's name, not the function under test: the
  name states what was supposed to happen.
* A check that cannot fail is not a check. Prove it — §5.

## 4. Cover the boundary, not the middle

The cases that decide the requirement sit at the edges of what it allows.

* The cases that matter: empty, one, many, the largest allowed, the smallest
  allowed, the malformed, the wrong type, the missing file, the error path.
* The middle of the range is the case that is already covered. It adds a line
  to the report and no evidence.
* Build the smallest fixture that exercises the behaviour. A fixture carrying
  more than the behaviour needs is another thing that can break the check.
* No sleeps, no network, no dependence on the wall clock. Seed the
  randomness.
* Read the clock through an argument the check controls; freeze the time the
  check depends on.
* Write into a temporary directory, never into the working tree.
* One case per requirement clause. A requirement with no case is a coverage
  gap, reported as a gap — never a silent pass.

## 5. Prove the check can fail

After you write a check, make it fail on purpose and show that it fails.

* Make it fail on purpose: invert the expectation, break the input, or revert
  the fix in a throwaway copy.
* Show the failure: quote the failing output, the command, and the case that
  failed. "It failed" is not evidence; the output is.
* Report the failing observation. It is the evidence that the check
  discriminates.
* A check never seen failing is a claim, not a check.
* Keep the evidence of the failure next to the check, so the next reader can
  repeat it.
* Break only the behaviour under test. A failure caused by a broken
  environment is not a demonstration that this check discriminates.
* Leave the tree as it was. The broken check was an experiment; restore it
  before the report.
* If the check will not fail when it should, the check is defective — fix it
  before you report the behaviour it claims to verify.

## 6. Report honestly

* Report what passed, what failed, what was blocked, and what was not tested.
  The four are different findings, and the report keeps them apart.
* A verdict without evidence is not a verdict. Name the check, the command and
  the result that support it.
* The requirement set wins over a report that disagrees with it. Where the two
  conflict, report the conflict; do not pick the one you can defend.
* A check that cannot be run in this environment is `not demonstrated`, never
  `met`. Say what blocked it and what would unblock it.
* Cite the requirement each check covers, and list the requirements with no
  check as gaps.
* Quote the evidence: the failing output, the passing run's summary, the
  command that produced it.
* Name the environment the check ran in, and where it differs from the
  environment the artifact runs in, say so in the report rather than in a
  footnote.
* Do not generalise a narrow pass. A passing check is evidence about the
  behaviour it covers, and about nothing else.
